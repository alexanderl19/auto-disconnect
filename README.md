### Custom Timer Length

When the Timer Threshold is met, Auto Disconnect starts a timer with this length and disconnects you from the meeting when the timer hits zero.

### Timer Threshold

Auto Disconnect starts the timer when the number of participants drops below this percentage of the maximum. For example, if a meeting has 20 participants and this percentage is set to 50%, you will be disconnected at 10 participants.

### Instant Disconnect Threshold

Auto Disconnect will instantly disconnect you when the number of participants drops below this percentage of the maximum. For example, if a meeting has 20 participants and this percentage is set to 10%, you will be instantly disconnected at 2 participants. Set this value to 0% to disable this feature.
